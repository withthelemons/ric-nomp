# Issues
Issues are always very welcome - after all, they are a big part of making any code better. However, there are a couple of things you can do to make the lives of the developers _much, much_ easier:

### Tell us:

* What you are doing?
  * What do you expect to happen?
  * What is actually happening?
  * Post an _enough_ log samples that indicates the issue
* Did you try to investigate the problem?
  * What are the results?
* Which OS and OS version you are using (Windows/Linux)?
* Which Node.js version you are using?
* Which coin software you are using and its version?

When you post code, please use [Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), in order to get proper syntax highlighting!

If you can even provide a pull request with a failing unit test, we will love you long time! Plus your issue will likely be fixed much faster.
